The Blanket Exercise has been offered across Canada, including in schools, to community groups, employers and the general public. The interactive and experiential 3 hour training teaches the Indigenous history through an Indigenous lens that explores the history of treaty-making, colonization and resistance, and is a cultural and historical awareness building session. The Blanket Exercise shows us that we are together on this journey of reconciliation.

More recently, I have been selected to represent one of the seven facilitators in the Ministry of Labour to deliver sessions across the GOA.
