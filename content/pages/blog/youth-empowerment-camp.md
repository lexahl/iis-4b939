The Youth Empowerment camp brings international youth from around the world together to build community capacity that begins with the acknowledgement of existing community resources. This camp identifies a variety of popular Indigenous art techniques to youth to identify their strengths, give them a space to articulate their voices and empower them to create change in their part of the world.

#### Indigenous Arts and Crafts â€“ campers learn how to make talking sticks during a storytelling session

By engaging youth in dialogue about issues affecting the places they live or groups they belong to, youth begin developing relationships with the people and organizations within their communities. Youth not only gain a better understanding of themselves, but also their communities. In time, youth will have the opportunity to build artistic skills to be meaningfully involved in the communities, increase resiliency, and increase their capacity in making healthy choices.
