As co-chair, it was a pleasure to coordinate this I.E.C. video project which explores 4 valuable Promising Practices to create a quality video product. The 4 Promising Practices identified include: Cultural Competence, Understanding Barriers, Setting a Welcoming Environment and It's Everyone's Job which set the tone for the future of I.E.C.

The video has been shared with various industry partners, municipalities, government, local businesses, educational institutions, Indigenous communities and training providers to assist in recruitment and retention of Indigenous employees and provide them with a means for welcoming new employees. The video serves to educate the public with respect to identifying indigenous perspectives, culture and values that exists in the Aboriginal workforce.
