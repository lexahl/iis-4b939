The Evergreen Learning and Innovation Centre inspires a culture of learning and innovation around responsible resource development. The centre engages a diverse group of stakeholders and empowers them to build a shared vision toward a sustainable future. The centre is managed by a volunteer society that foster relationships through the sharing of innovative technologies, traditional ecological knowledge and wise practices that reduces impact on the environment.

#### Indigenous Perspectives on Responsible Resource Development

The knowledge I have gained through my enduring relationship with the land creates a unique perspective towards sustainable resource management. The concept of responsible resource development is not new to Indigenous people: we are aware of the need to respect the environment if we are to coexist in this world.

Traditionally, Indigenous people have exemplified the qualities of good stewardship in their interactions with the environment. In conducting these activities, I respectfully consider the growth, reproduction, and regenerations cycles of plants, animals and birds. This knowledge of the natural environment reflects the importance of sustaining Mother Earth for several generations to come. In return, the learners feel empowered to make a difference and they gain a greater appreciation for the wisdom and hope for the future.
