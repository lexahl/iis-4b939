The interactive five-day camp at Camp Tamarack introduced 8 Metis females ages 15-16 to a variety of career options the health and sciences, forestry and oil and gas industries. The students participated in a variety of leadership building and self-esteem activities. They also had the opportunity to learn about various community programs from a number of presenters, industry tours, career information sessions and experiential sessions related to MeÃÅtis culture, as well as, engaging activities in a culturally safe learning environment for everyone.

The primary objective of this camp is to promote that availability of career, employment and education information and services for youth entering into health and science related careers.

Students were taken on a guided natural mother earth medicine tour in an outdoor setting as the connection to the land is important in order to fully understand and appreciate the elements and concepts (i.e.: outdoor learning through youth cultural camps). The innate connection to the land is important in order to fully understand the complex interrelationships between individuals and the environment. The students had the opportunity to harvest a variety of herbs and make a cold fusion tea along with poplar bud salve making.

The students also had an opportunity in a sharing circle to discuss the advantages of post- secondary education and talk about life experiences as a student. Each day began with a smudging ceremony and sharing circle. The students were acknowledged for their success and family members joined in on the celebration on the final day. The students were given certificates and a gift of appreciation.
