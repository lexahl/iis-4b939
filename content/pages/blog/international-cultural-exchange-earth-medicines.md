An Indigenous Perspective on Medicine and Healing: a half-day session that covers the traditional Indigenous healing methods through the use of plants for medicine. I share how these ancient traditional methods play a role in connection to our own roots, how we can integrate that in our own practices, and the importance of our roles as stewards of the land based medicines. Many of the plants harvested were used by Indigenous people in the boreal forests of the northern hemisphere for over 500 generations, especially for treatment of ailments.

The goal is to help participants be able to use these plants in their daily lives. The plant walk explores the native plants and looks at the edible, medicinal and survival aspects of the flora. Topics covered include plant identification, sustainable harvesting, treatments for common ailments and spiritual properties. Most of which can be harvested various times of year, grown locally or purchased.
