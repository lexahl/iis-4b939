      Winona dedicates her knowledge and ways of being to her Obijway ancestors.
      As the founder of Indigenous Innovative Solutions Inc., Winona brings
      together Indigenous knowledge, providing an Indigenous voice and effective
      solutions to age old challenges. Critical global dialogue on the
      importance of Indigenous perspectives for a sustainable future is required
      to ensure viability of livelihoods of future generations.


      She is deeply rooted and connected to the land, where she continues her
      lifelong journey to learn more about the traditional plant foods and
      medicines in the western boreal forest. Incorporating sustainably
      harvested and sourced botanicals, IIS Inc., unites ancestral traditions
      with modern wise practices, empowering people to connect to themselves and
      the natural world.
