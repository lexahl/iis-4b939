      As a passionate artist and cultural advisor of the Ojibway nation, it has
      been a privilege and a great honour to share my gifts from the creator and
      mother earth. I give thanks to those traditional teachers, elders and
      gifted individuals who offered their guidance and respect to passing on
      the Indigenous culture and wisdom. My respect and gratitude goes out to
      each individual for sharing their knowledge and experience with openness,
      rigor and vision, a vision that I am proud to pass on to others.


      To understand the reality of Indigenous art in practice today, history and
      context must be taken into consideration. Many artists consider
      contemporary art practices to be a process of re-appropriation, healing
      and reclaiming.


      The uniqueness of Indigenous art forms exists nowhere else in the world.
      This is partly due to the original expressions deriving from the land
      before contact. There is a profound connection between the land, the
      people, the language and the culture. The land knows how to take care of
      us.


      There are also cultural values employed that form Indigenous art practices
      and they include: respect, sharing, openness, humility and harmony. These
      values are inspired from traditional value systems such as the teepee
      teachings, the medicine wheel, the sweat lodge ceremony, to name a few.
      These are inter-generational teachings, stories and legends that are
      passed on through imagery and dance.


      Through community consultation and many yearsâ€™ experience in building
      leadership skills, sharing of traditions and cultural teachings and
      personal empowerment, education has always been at the forefront. Working
      with various cultural groups and teaching at university level has provided
      me with the foundational skills and knowledge required to pursue my
      journey in sharing our stories and gifts.
