      With the globalization of business, increased diversity in the workplace
      and multicultural emphasis in society, cultural awareness has become one
      of the most important business tools in almost every industry.
      Understanding the cultures of those around you will enhance communication,
      productivity and unity in the workplace. Formal cross-cultural awareness
      training is very helpful for problem solving on multicultural business
      teams, but there are several cultural awareness techniques you can use in
      the meantime.
