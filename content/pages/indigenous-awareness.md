      With the globalization of business, increased diversity in the workplace
      and multicultural emphasis in society, cultural awareness has become one
      of the most important business tools in almost every industry.
      Understanding the cultures of those around you will enhance communication,
      productivity and unity in the workplace. Formal cross-cultural awareness
      training is very helpful for problem solving on multicultural business
      teams, but there are several cultural awareness techniques you can use in
      the meantime.

        title: Cultural Knowledge
        text: >-
          One of the easiest ways to understand your coworkers is by researching
          cultures on your free time and increasing your cultural knowledge.
          Reading books and talking to others are the most accessible sources of
          relevant information. Although you might not ever put to use most of
          the knowledge you accrue, you will still be able to better understand
          those you work with.

        title: Put Cultural Knowledge to Use
        text: >-
          If you learn something interesting about a coworker's culture, ask
          about it or mention it in a relevant situation. This might seem
          uncomfortable at first, but your coworkers will recognize your effort
          to educate yourself. Using acquired information as it comes up will
          serve to break down multicultural barriers, help everyone on your team
          to be more comfortable around each other and teach others about
          different cultures.

        title: Listen Up
        text: >-
          Effective listening is something that most cultures have in common.
          Listen to your coworkers actively, displaying positive body language
          and affirmation during the listening process. Listening intently
          allows you to read between the lines, pay attention to the way your
          coworkers say things and ask questions if anything is unclear. They
          will recognize your willingness to listen and appreciate being asked
          to explain an unclear point.

        title: Overcome Stereotypes
        subtitle: ''
        text: >-
          Stereotypes and preconceived ideas are difficult to overcome,
          especially if they have been part of your thinking since childhood.
          Educate yourself about as many different cultures as you can and treat
          everyone the same. Your knowledge of their culture will give you the
          confidence you need to overcome the stereotypes that have been
          engraved in your memory. This newly found knowledge will replace your
          negative stereotypes with positive knowledge.

    title: What is cross cultural awareness?
    text: "Cross cultural awareness is figuring out why people from backgrounds that differ from our own act the way they do and using that information to have better relationships with those them. It will help you predict how people who come from different backgrounds will act, speak, think, make decisions and perceive the world.\n\nIt is important to note that this does not mean endorsing stereotypes or pigeonholing people into categories. It is about being open-minded and willing to understand others for who they are.\n\n#### Who needs cross cultural awareness?\n\nAnyone who deals with people from different cultures needs cross cultural awareness. Canada is one of the most multi-cultural nations in the world. We need it on a daily basis - in business, when [shopping](http://www.city-choices.com/newyork-city-guide/placecategory/shopping-in-newyork-ny/), when socializing - in just about any situation when we interact with others.\n\n#### Why is cross-cultural awareness important for your business?\n\nIf people from other cultures want to do business with us and interact with us, why don't they [learn](http://www.parexcellencemagazine.com/business-career-advice/event-planning/1115-what-is-the-best-room-set-up-for-a-live-event.html) our customs? Often they do. But that is only half of the battle. If you make the effort to learn about your counterpart, you will both be making the effort to understand each other, doubling your effort and chances for success.\n\nWhile your counterpart may act like you and sound like you, he or she isn't. That person may think in a different language, process information in a different way and make decisions differently than you do. If you understand how [culture](http://www.parexcellencemagazine.com/culture-and-lifestyle.html) may affect this person's character, you may give yourself an edge in business and in cross cultural communication.\n\n#### How do we become more cross culturally aware and master cross cultural communication skills?\n\n1.  The media - Although sometimes we can learn interesting material from the media, it is good to be aware of sensationalism and media bias. It is important to remain open-minded and non-judgmental.\n2.  Relationships - By interacting with people and learning about their culture directly from them. People are usually delighted to about the customs and culture of their homeland. Many of us are embarrassed to ask questions because we fear that we will be judged as ignorant. More often than not, non-judgmental questions that are motivated by a sincere interest to learn and understand are answered with enthusiasm.\n3.  By educating ourselves - If you know that you are going to be dealing with someone from another culture it pays to do your homework. The Internet and general interest reading material may be helpful.\n    Some things that may be helpful to know before dealing with someone from another culture include, for example:\n    •\t*Basic geography:* What countries or regions border the other person's homeland? What is the [capital](http://www.parexcellencemagazine.com/business-career-advice/financing-your-business/176-advice-for-women-entrepreneurs-to-acquire-growth-capital-in-the-hunt.html)\_[city](http://www.city-choices.com/) there?\n    •\t*Basic *[*politics*](http://www.parexcellencemagazine.com/culture-and-lifestyle/politics-a-society.html)*:* Is their state governed by a President, Prime Minister, the military or royalty?\n    •\t*Forms of address and greeting*: Knowing what to call a person and how to greet people properly can win you friends, contracts and lifelong associations. Not doing so, or making a blundered attempt, can insult and may be remembered for a long time. When in doubt, ask how your counterpart would like to be addressed. If nothing else, this shows respect on your part.\n    •\t*Customs and table manners: *This is a topic in and of itself, but suffice to say that if you will be dining with people from another culture, it is worthwhile to find out what their customs are. Take the time to learn about this before you sit down at the table.\n\nBy making the attempt to improve your cross cultural communication skills and become cross culturally aware you will expand your mind as you learn more about the world around you, give yourself an edge in business and negotiations, and enjoy friendships with people from diverse backgrounds. When you become cross culturally aware, you gain the riches of the whole world. Isn't it worth it?"
