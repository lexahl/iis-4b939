      With the globalization of business, increased diversity in the workplace
      and multicultural emphasis in society, cultural awareness has become one
      of the most important business tools in almost every industry.
      Understanding the cultures of those around you will enhance communication,
      productivity and unity in the workplace. Formal cross-cultural awareness
      training is very helpful for problem solving on multicultural business
      teams, but there are several cultural awareness techniques you can use in
      the meantime.

        title: Cultural Knowledge
        text: >-
          One of the easiest ways to understand your coworkers is by researching
          cultures on your free time and increasing your cultural knowledge.
          Reading books and talking to others are the most accessible sources of
          relevant information. Although you might not ever put to use most of
          the knowledge you accrue, you will still be able to better understand
          those you work with.

        title: Put Cultural Knowledge to Use
        text: >-
          If you learn something interesting about a coworker's culture, ask
          about it or mention it in a relevant situation. This might seem
          uncomfortable at first, but your coworkers will recognize your effort
          to educate yourself. Using acquired information as it comes up will
          serve to break down multicultural barriers, help everyone on your team
          to be more comfortable around each other and teach others about
          different cultures.

        title: Listen Up
        text: >-
          Effective listening is something that most cultures have in common.
          Listen to your coworkers actively, displaying positive body language
          and affirmation during the listening process. Listening intently
          allows you to read between the lines, pay attention to the way your
          coworkers say things and ask questions if anything is unclear. They
          will recognize your willingness to listen and appreciate being asked
          to explain an unclear point.

        title: Overcome Stereotypes
        subtitle: ''
        text: >-
          Stereotypes and preconceived ideas are difficult to overcome,
          especially if they have been part of your thinking since childhood.
          Educate yourself about as many different cultures as you can and treat
          everyone the same. Your knowledge of their culture will give you the
          confidence you need to overcome the stereotypes that have been
          engraved in your memory. This newly found knowledge will replace your
          negative stereotypes with positive knowledge.
