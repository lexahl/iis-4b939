      With the globalization of business, increased diversity in the workplace
      and multicultural emphasis in society, cultural awareness has become one
      of the most important business tools in almost every industry.
      Understanding the cultures of those around you will enhance communication,
      productivity and unity in the workplace. Formal cross-cultural awareness
      training is very helpful for problem solving on multicultural business
      teams, but there are several cultural awareness techniques you can use in
      the meantime.

          One of the easiest ways to understand your coworkers is by researching
          cultures on your free time and increasing your cultural knowledge.
          Reading books and talking to others are the most accessible sources of
          relevant information. Although you might not ever put to use most of
          the knowledge you accrue, you will still be able to better understand
          those you work with.
